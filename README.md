# RigFlex - Simple Soft Body for Armatures

# 1.0 Introduction
The movement of many animated characters is improved by some sort of soft body simulation. Antennas, clothing, tails, feathers, scales - you name it. Blender has a variety of techniques for this, often using soft body or cloth simulation applied to a lattice or mesh which in turn is applied to the cahracter mesh via modifiers. It's very flexible and powerful, but take some effort to set up.

However, there is no soft body for armatures, and often an acurate simulation is not the goal, just a simple first order lag to the movement of some of the mesh.
